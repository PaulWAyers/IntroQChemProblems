# IntroQChemProblems

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PaulWAyers/IntroQChemProblems/HEAD)

This repository contains notebooks for notes, problems, and solutions for the Introduction to Quantum Chemistry course, CHEM 3PA3.
The notebooks in ipynb directory can be run via mybinder.org by clicking on the badge above.

The main rationale for this repo was that students were having to clone the entire IntroQChem repository to get assignments and keys, which took a lot of (unnecessary) disk space. This approach is more effective.

## Problems and Solutions
- [Computing Course Marks](ipynb/grading.ipynb) 
- [Introduction to Quantum](ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb); [key including extra problems](ipynb/IntroQMkey.ipynb)

## Notes
1. [From Newton to Schr√∂dinger](ipynb/History.ipynb)
2. [The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation](ipynb/SchrodingerEq.ipynb)
3. [The Particle in a Box](ipynb/ParticleIn1DBox.ipynb)
4. [Particles confined in two and three dimensions](ipynb/ParticleInMultiD.ipynb)
5. [The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics](ipynb/Postulates.ipynb)
6. 1-electron atoms
7. Approximate Methods
8. Many-electron systems
9. 2-electron atoms
10. Approximate Methods for Many-Electron Systems
## Other resources
Keys to assignments are not always available. But where available, instructors can have the keys by e-mailing Paul Ayers, <ayers@mcmaster.ca>, from your official e-mail account. Where possible, `nbgrader` can be used to mark assignments.
